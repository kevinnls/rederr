[BUG]: out_format leaks into err_format

```
out_format='47;32' err_format='31' rederr stdouterr
```

the above sets bgcolor white on stdout
as well as stderr

leak occurs even when no output is printed
[`stdouterr -t` (don't print output)]

i would assume this is because buffered vs unbuffered

bug will not occur if both out_ and err_ set their
own attributes of the same type/opposing attributes, i.e.

```
out_format='47;32' err_format='40;31' rederr stdouterr
```
out_ sets bg white; err_ sets bg black

```
out_format='4;32' err_format='24;31' rederr stdouterr
```
out_ underlines; err_ unsets underline
